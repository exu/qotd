* The Orangutan Effect

"If you sit down with an orangutan and carefully explain to it one of your cherished ideas, you may leave behind a puzzled primate, but will exit thinking more clearly yourself."

Teaching others actually teaches yourself. 

* The Faulty Premise Framework

“A horse that can count to ten is a remarkable horse - not  a remarkable mathematician.”

Beware your comparison set. 

Are you judging crappy relative performance or absolute results?

* Pick the Right Business Boat
 
The business boat you get into is more important than how effectively you row.

“When a  brilliant management team tackles a business with a reputation for poor fundamental economics, the reputation of the business usually stays intact.”

1985

* A Rising Tide Doesn't Lift All Bonuses

"Good performance should be rewarded whether Berkshire stock rises or falls. 
Average performance should earn no special rewards even if our stock soars."

Judge for individual performance or risk free riding on group success.

* Preaching Never Outweighs Performance

Everyone tries to predict the future. 

But it's a loser's game.

* Buffett's GEICO Principle (his best investment ever):

* What Businesses Buffett will Buy:

1) Consistent earning power: future  projections are useless

2) Good returns on equity with little or no debt

3) Management in place: we can’t supply it

4) Simple businesses: if there’s lots of tech, we won't get it

1985

* Hire Giants, Avoid Dwarfs

"If we hire people who are smaller than us, we become a company of dwarfs. 

But, if we hire people who are bigger than us, we become a company of giants."

Great hiring makes you the dumbest in the room.

1987

* The Buffett Management Philosophy

Buy businesses with superstar managers.

"If we did more business operating, less would be accomplished. 

Instead, get out of the way.

If you coach a basketball team with Lebron James, don't tell him how to dribble the ball. 

1988

* Pick a Job Where Your Time Horizon is Forever 

"Berkshire is my first love and one that will never  fade: 

At Harvard Business School last year, a student asked  me when I planned to retire and I replied, 

"About five to ten years after I die."

1998

* Great Talent Never Solves a Bad Business

"Good jockeys will do well on good horses, but not on broken-down nags."
It doesn't matter how good you are.

Pick the wrong market or a bad business model and you fail. 

What you work on matters more than anything else.
